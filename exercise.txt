✅ How to practice properly (IMPORTANT)

✔ First write SELECT before UPDATE/DELETE
✔ Run queries one by one
✔ If stuck → think in steps:

Filter rows (WHERE)

Group data (GROUP BY)

Filter groups (HAVING)

Sort (ORDER BY)

🧠 When you finish these exercises

You will be confident in:

SELECT, WHERE, ORDER BY

GROUP BY & HAVING

Aggregate functions

Date functions

UPDATE & DELETE

Custom ORDER BY
